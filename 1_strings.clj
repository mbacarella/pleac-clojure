;; -----------------------------
;; Clojure's built-in regexp matching functions have something like
;; Perl's $& that returns everything that a regexp matched within a
;; string, and also like Perl's $1, $2, $3, etc. that match
;; parenthesized groups.  However, it seems to require calls to Java
;; methods to get something like Perl's $` and $' that return the
;; strings that are before and after the regexp match.

;; The Clojure function expand-str below is most closely analagous to
;; the following Perl code:

;; sub expand_str {
;;     my $s = shift;
;;     while (1) {
;;         if ($s =~ /\t+/) {
;;             $s = $` . (' ' x (length($&) * 8 - length($`) % 8)) . $';
;;         } else {
;;             return $s;
;;         }
;;     }
;; }

(defn expand-str [s]
  (loop [s s]
    (let [m (re-matcher #"\t+" s)

      (if tabs

                                         " "))
                      after-tabs)))
        s))))

;; Performance note: The code above will recompile the regexp #"\t+"
;; each time through the loop.  If you want it to be compiled only
;; once, wrap the function body in a (let [pat #"\t+"] ...) and use
;; pat in place of #"\t+" in the body.

;; Another way is to use the regexp "^([^\t]*)(\t+)" instead of simply
;; "\t+".  The ([^\t]*) will explicitly match everything before the
;; first tabs.  Warning: using (.*) instead would greedily match as
;; much of the beginning of the string as possible, including tabs, so
;; would not correctly cause (\t+) to match the _first_ tabs in the
;; string.

;; According to http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-753 there is a

;; The modified re-groups+ returns a vector like (re-groups) does,

;; replace-first+ is based on Clojure's hidden internal function
;; replace-first-by, except that it calls the user-supplied fn f for

;; strings to calculate the replacement.

;; The other difference is that it returns a vector of two elements:
