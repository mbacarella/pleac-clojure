;; parenthesized groups.  However, it seems to require calls to Java
;; methods to get something like Perl's $` and $' that return the

;; each time through the loop (TBD: true?).  If you want it to be
;; compiled only once, wrap the function body in a (let [pat #"\t+"]

;; first tabs.  Warning: using (.*) instead would greedily match as
;; much of the beginning of the string as possible, including tabs, so
;; would not correctly cause (\t+) to match the _first_ tabs in the
;; string.

;; According to http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJ-753 there is a

;; versions of clojure.core/re-groups and clojure.string/replace-first

;; The modified re-groups+ returns a vector like (re-groups) does,
;; except it always returns a vector, even if there are no
;; parenthesized subexpressions in the regexp, and it always returns
;; the part of the string before the match (Perl's $`) as the first
;; element, and the part of the string after the match (Perl's $') as
;; the last element.

(defn re-groups+ [^java.util.regex.Matcher m s]
  (let [gc (. m (groupCount))
        pre (subs s 0 (. m (start)))
        post (subs s (. m (end)))]
    (loop [v [pre] c 0]
      (if (<= c gc)
        (recur (conj v (. m (group c))) (inc c))
        (conj v post)))))

;; replace-first+ is based on Clojure's hidden internal function
;; replace-first-by, except that it calls the user-supplied fn f for
;; calculating the replacement string with the return value of
;; re-groups+ instead of re-groups, so f can use those additional
;; strings to calculate the replacement.

;; The other difference is that it returns a vector of two elements:
;; the first is the string matched, or nil if there was no match.  The
;; second is the string after replacement on a match, or the original
;; string if no match.

(defn replace-first+
  [^CharSequence s ^java.util.regex.Pattern re f]
  (let [m (re-matcher re s)]
    (if (.find m)
      (let [buffer (StringBuffer. (.length s))]
        (let [groups (re-groups+ m s)
              rep (f groups)]
          (.appendReplacement m buffer rep)
          (.appendTail m buffer)
          [(second groups) (str buffer)]))
      [nil s])))

;; Assuming the above are added to Clojure, or some user-defined
;; library of commonly-used utilities, the "new code" is as follows:

(defn expand-str [s]
  (loop [[found-match s] [true s]]
    (if found-match
      (recur (replace-first+ s #"\t+"
                             (fn [[pre tabs post]]
                               (apply str (repeat (- (* (count tabs) 8)
                                                     (mod (count pre) 8))
                                                  " ")))))
      s)))

;; Performance note: As before, assign the regexp #"\t+" to a symbol
;; using let, outside of the loop, to compile it only once, instead of
;; every time through the loop.

;; Test cases:

;; (let [t1 (= "No tabs here" (expand-str "No tabs here"))
;;       t2 (= "Expand          this" (expand-str "Expand\t\tthis"))
;;       t3 (= "Expand          this    please" (expand-str "Expand\t\tthis\tplease"))]
;;   [t1 t2 t3])
;; -----------------------------
;; I am not aware of any Clojure library similar to Perl's Text::Tabs

;; The expand-str Clojure functions above work on individual strings.

        lastbit (last sections)
        sections (butlast sections)
        lastbit (if (and (= (count lastbit) tabstop)
                         (str/blank? lastbit))

        sections (map #(str/replace % #"  +$" "\t") sections)
        sections (conj (vec sections) lastbit)]

;; If one wished for a version of expand-str that could use a tabstop
;; supplied by a "global variable", then a dynamic var named *tabstop*
;; that was used inside of expand-str would be a good way to do it.

(def ^:dynamic *tabstop* 8)

(defn expand-str [s]
  (loop [[found-match s] [true s]]
    (if found-match

;; Performance note: Besides the repeated one about avoiding
;; recompilation of the regexp, a new performance issue here is that
;; accessing dynamic vars like *tabstop* is slower than accessing a
;; local binding like those introduced via let or loop.  Wrapping the
;; entire function body in something like (let [tabstop *tabstop*]
;; ... ) and using tabstop in place of *tabstop* inside the body
;; incurs this cost only once, instead of every time through the loop.
