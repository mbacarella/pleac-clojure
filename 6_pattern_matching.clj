;;-----------------------------
;; Clojure does have functions for matching in strings, and replacing
;; matches in strings.
(require '[clojure.string :as str])

(re-find pattern string)
(str/replace-first string pattern replacement)
;;-----------------------------
;; Clojure does not have special syntax for re-find and str/replace
;; above, but it does have a little bit of special syntax for creating
;; regexes (i.e. regular expressions).

;; You can create a java.util.regex.Pattern by putting it in
;; double-quotes and preceding that with the character #, like this:
(def pat1a #"\d+")

;; That is equivalent to the following two examples.  The first uses
;; Clojure's re-pattern, and the second explicitly calls the compile()
;; method of java.util.regex.Pattern class.
(def pat1b (re-pattern "\\d+"))   ; equivalent
(def pat1c (java.util.regex.Pattern/compile "\\d+"))

;; Note that it is a bit nicer to use #"pattern", because you don't
;; need to escape \ characters by preceding them with another \.  This
;; is good, because \ characters are fairly common in regexes, and
;; they get tedious to write, and read, with extra occurrences.
;; Compare these, for example:

;; Pattern that matches:
;; \\    a single backslash,
;; \d+   followed by one or more digits,
;; \s+   followed by one or more whitespace characters,
;; \S+   followed by one or more non-whitespace characters
(def pat2a #"\\\d+\s+\S+")

;; Compare that to the following mess if you don't use #"pattern".
;; Every \ in the pattern must be escaped with its own preceding \.
(def pat2b (re-pattern "\\\\\\d+\\s+\\S+"))  ; ugh!

;; On to Clojure code that match the behavior of the Perl examples.

;; Perl: $meadow =~ m/sheep/;   # True if $meadow contains "sheep"
(re-find #"sheep" meadow)   ; true if meadow contains "sheep"

;; Perl: $meadow !~ m/sheep/;   # True if $meadow doesn't contain "sheep"
(not (re-find #"sheep" meadow))  ; true if meadow doesn't contain "sheep"

;; Perl: $meadow =~ s/old/new/; # Replace "old" with "new" in $meadow
;; The Perl example modifies the string meadow in place.  The Clojure
;; example below does not modify meadow, because its value is an
;; immutable string.  It returns a new string that is the same as
;; meadow, except with the first occurrence of "old" replaced with
;; "new", if "old" occurs in meadow, otherwise it returns the original
;; string that is the value of meadow.
(str/replace-first meadow #"old" "new")
;;-----------------------------
;; There is a lot of similarity between special character sequences
;; that can be used in Perl regexes and java.util.regex.Pattern
;; regexes, but they are not identical.  See java.util.regex.Pattern
;; documentation for details.  If you are familiar with Perl 5
;; regexes, see especially the section of the Java docs titled
;; "Comparison to Perl 5".

;; Note that (?i) should be at the beginning to make the whole pattern
;; match case-insensitively.  If you put it in the middle, everything
;; in the pattern from that point onward will match
;; case-insensitively, but nothing before that will.  You can also use
;; (?-i) to turn off case-insensitive matching in the middle, after it
;; has been turned on earlier.

;; Here are correspondences between Perl regex modifiers and Java
;; regex modifiers:

;; /i Ignore alphabetic case       (?i) at *beginning* of pattern (or
;;                                 wherever you want ignoring case to
;;                                 begin in the pattern).  Same comment
;;                                 applies for other Java regex modifiers.
;;                                 This is for ignoring case of US-ASCII
;;                                 characters only.  (?u) is for Unicode.

;; /x Ignore most whitespace       (?x)
;;    in pattern and permit
;;    comments

;; /g Global - match/substitute    There is no corresponding modifier
;;    as often as possible         for this in a Java regex.  A different
;;                                 call must be made, e.g. re-seq instead
;;                                 of re-find, or clojure.string/replace
;;                                 instead of clojure.string/replace-first

;; /gc Don't reset search position  TBD: Is there something that
;;     on failed match.             corresponds to this with Java regexes?

;; /s Let . match newline.         (?s)

;; /m Let ^ and $ match next to    (?m)
;;    embedded \n

;; /o Compile pattern only once.   Java and Clojure do this differently,
;;                                 with explicit calls that perform
;;                                 compilation.  TBD: Give Clojure examples
;;                                 with repeated vs. once-only compilation.

;; /e Righthand side of a s///     Clojure clojure.string/replace and
;;    is code to eval              clojure.string/replace-all can take a function
;;                                 as the last argument.  The function
;;                                 takes the matching string as an argument,
;;                                 and returns a string that is the replacement.

;; /ee Righthand side of a s///    TBD: Look for Perl examples, and see if/how
;;     is a string to eval, then   they can be written in Clojure.
;;     run as code, and its return
;;     value eval'led again.
;;-----------------------------
;; Note: If you use the pattern #"(\d+)" here, each element of the
;; sequence returned by re-seq will have a vector of 2 strings.  The
;; first is the entire matching string, the second is the one that
;; matches the first parenthesized group in the pattern.  Since it is
;; good enough in this case to get the strings matched by the entire
;; pattern, don't bother putting it in parentheses.

;; The Perl example implicitly searches for matches within the string
;; $_.  In the example below, we explicitly name the string to search
;; 'string'.
(let [string "Testing 1 time how many 2 numbers 9384592 I can find in the -92 middle."]
  (doseq [num-str (re-seq #"\d+" string)]
    (printf "Found number %s\n" num-str)))

      nonlap (map second (re-seq #"(\d\d\d)" digits))
      yeslap (map second (re-seq #"(?=(\d\d\d))" digits))]
  (printf "Non-overlapping:  %s\n" (str/join " " nonlap))
  (printf "Overlapping:      %s\n" (str/join " " yeslap)))
;;-----------------------------
;; Java and Clojure regexes do not have anything exactly corresponding
;; to Perl's $` and $'.

;; The most straigtforward way to get both of them is to put
;; ^(?s)(.*?)  before a pattern, and (.*)$ after it, and use the
;; strings matched by those parenthesized expressions.  This will work
;; as long as it is OK for . in the original pattern to match newline
;; characters -- otherwise leave out the (?s) and use something like
;; ^((.|\n)*?)  before and ((.|\n)*)$ after.  Or if you happen to know
;; that the string you are matching against won't contain newlines,
;; ^(.*?) and (.*)$ are good enough.

;; If you leave out the ? in ^(.*?), then that pattern will greedily
;; match, possibly causing the original pattern to match starting
;; later in the string than it would if you used only it.

(let [string "And little lambs eat ivy"
      match (re-find #"^(.*?)(l[^s]*s)(.*)$" string)]
  (printf "(%s) (%s) (%s)\n" (match 1) (match 2) (match 3)))

;; Another way is to write a modified version of re-find that uses the
;; re-groups+ defined in Section 1.8.

;; @@PLEAC@@_6.1 Copying and Substituting Simultaneously
;;-----------------------------
;; Because Clojure strings are immutable, there is effectively no
;; choice to edit a string in place, vs. copy it and then edit it.
;; You use clojure.string/replace-first or clojure.string/replace to
;; create a new string with replacements made in the original one, and
;; the original one always remains unchanged.

;; You could write this:
(let [dst src

;; TBD: Consider writing Clojure functions range-inc and range-exc
;; that take the contents of a line/record string as an argument,
;; and/or a function of two arguments (the string and the line/record
;; number) returning a logical true or false value, and behaves like
;; Perl's .. or ... operators.  The syntax would be more verbose than
;; Perl's, but it should work.
